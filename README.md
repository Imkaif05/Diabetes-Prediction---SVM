### Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine

📊 Model's Overview  : 

- Algorithm : Support Vector Machine with Linear Kernel 
- Dataset : [diabetes.csv](https://lnkd.in/gDyTk5CU)

📝 Important Steps : 

1. Data Collection & Analysis 
2. Separating the Input & Output labels
3. Data Standardization
4. Train-Test Split
5. Training the SVM model with training dataset
6. Testing the model with test dataset
7. Evaluation of the Model : Confusion Matrix ,Classification Report 
8. Making a Predictive System : A function that will take input from the patient and tells if the patient is diabetic or not
